> **Purpose**: This site catalogs validated simulation models across domains to combat fragmentation in engineering workflows. By centralizing proven tools and industry standards, we eliminate redundant physics development—saving 80-90% engineering time while leveraging decades of validation. **Stop reinventing the wheel**: inherit robust cores, innovate at boundaries.
