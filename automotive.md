Here is a list of great automotive models (AI generated content):

-------------------------------------------------------------

# **CARLA Autonomous Driving Simulator**

**CARLA** is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research, providing photorealistic urban environments, sensor simulation, and traffic scenarios for developing and validating AD/ADAS systems.

CARLA typically supports:
- Unreal Engine 5 rendering with customizable weather, time-of-day, and traffic patterns.
- Sensor suite including LIDAR, RGB cameras, depth cameras, radar, IMU, and GNSS.
- OpenDRIVE maps, Python API for scenario generation, and ROS2/Autoware integration.
- Multi-agent traffic simulation with pedestrian and vehicle behaviors for edge case testing.

## License and Cost

CARLA is open-source under MIT license, completely free to download, modify, and use for research and commercial applications.

## Limitations

High GPU requirements for photorealistic rendering. Primarily focused on perception and planning rather than chassis/powertrain dynamics.

# **Eclipse SUMO Traffic Simulator**

**Eclipse SUMO** is an open-source, microscopic traffic simulation package for modeling large-scale multimodal traffic networks with high-fidelity vehicle behaviors.

SUMO typically supports:
- Road traffic simulation with individual vehicle dynamics, route choice, and traffic lights.
- Multimodal transport including cars, trucks, buses, pedestrians, and public transit.
- OpenDRIVE/TraCI integration for dynamic control and V2X communication simulation.
- Large-scale network support with millions of vehicles and real-world map import.

## License and Cost

SUMO is open-source under Eclipse Public License v2.0, free across all platforms.

## Limitations

2D top-down visualization focused on traffic flow rather than 3D driving simulation or sensor modeling.

# **BeamNG.research Vehicle Simulator**

**BeamNG.research** is a soft-body physics vehicle simulator with realistic crash dynamics, used for ADAS testing, sensor simulation, and chassis development.

BeamNG.research typically supports:
- Node-beam soft-body physics for realistic deformation, crashes, and tire-road interaction.
- Lua API for traffic scenarios, sensor simulation, and autonomous control.
- High-fidelity vehicle models with suspension, powertrain, and aerodynamics.
- Python bridge for machine learning integration and scenario replay.

## License and Cost

BeamNG.research offers free research license for non-commercial use with full feature access.

## Limitations

Proprietary core engine with limited extensibility compared to fully open-source alternatives.

# **Veins Vehicular Network Simulator**

**Veins** is an open-source framework for vehicular network simulation combining OMNeT++ networking with SUMO traffic simulation for V2X research.

Veins typically supports:
- IEEE 802.11p/DSRC, C-V2X, and 5G NR V2X protocol simulation.
- Realistic radio propagation with obstacles, buildings, and terrain effects.
- Application layer protocols for safety, traffic efficiency, and platooning.
- Bidirectional coupling between network events and vehicle maneuvers.

## License and Cost

Veins is open-source under GPL license, completely free for research applications.

## Limitations

Networking-focused simulation without 3D visualization or perception sensors.
